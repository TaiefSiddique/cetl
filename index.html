    <h2>About CETL</h2>
    <p>
        The British Council supported the University Grants Commission (UGC) in Bangladesh to establish CETLs in six public universities that were spread over the major geographic divisions in the country during the first phase of its operation. Each of these centres has a wider geographical spread so that each could become a regional hub working with neighbouring institutions within remote districts. With time, four private universities came on board to this network. 

        After the inital phase of CETL ends to meet the British Council’s aim of establishing the importance of teaching and learning concept into the Higher Education (HE) sector, that has been strongly acknowledged by UGC. The initiative has not only been successfully meeting the emerging need of teaching and learning in HE but also the British Council’s role to influence university policies. These were coupled with the formal establishment of the CETLs within institutions and for UGC to develop a comprehensive plan which shall also include the curriculum and resource development. The CETL project is an example of a low cost or high impact project. It also aims at forming a sustainable hub with new inclusions into the model for strengthening the technique of teaching and learning techniques widely.
